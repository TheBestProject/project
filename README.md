BOARD ROOM - A collaborative whiteboarding environment.

What?

Logging in grants you access to any group or project you are associated with and all of the 
most up to date individual or team whiteboards in real time, for your projects, ideas and more.

Written using the PERN stack and with the following technologies utilized:

Redux,
Axios,
Sass,
Auth0,
Socket.IO,
HTML5 Canvas,

Why?

The need for this project was realized after searching for a collaborative environment with
emphasis on whiteboarding. After not being satisfied with any options available to us, 
We three students from the coding bootcamp DevMountain located in Provo, Utah took it upon ourselves to write this application as our conclusive project to the program.
